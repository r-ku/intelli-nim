# Nim language plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

## Features
* SDK selection
* Syntax highlighting

## Build instructions

To build the project with a clean IntelliJ Community Edition 14 installation:

1. Set up Java SDK
2. Set up Idea IntelliJ SDK and name it "IntelliJ IDEA".
3. Select Idea IntelliJ SDK for the project.
4. You should be able to build the project and debug it with F5.

To be able to work on parser you need to install additional plugins:
- Grammar-Kit
- PsiViewer (nice to have, especially installed in sand-boxed instance the one launched with debugger)

### Update lexer

Note! Lexer source file (nim.flex) was generated automatically from nim.bnf and then manually edited.
It was generated by:
- right click on src/nim/grammar/nim.bnf and choose "Generate JFlex Lexer"
- choose src/grammar folder
- Open nim.bnf, see which tokens are marked and delete them from _NimGrammarLexer.java according to instructions.

Having nim.flex file ready, next step is to generate NimLexer class by:
- right click on src/nim/grammar/_NimGrammarLexer.flex and choose "Run JFlex Generator"
- choose src/grammar folder

### Update parser

- right click on src/nim/grammar/nim.bnf and choose "Generate Parser Code"
